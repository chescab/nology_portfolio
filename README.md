I am currently on the process of finishing a Software Developer course at Nology.
This project will be my portfolio. I will update it as I go along.

The first challenge was to use what we've learned from Module 2 to build a prototype of our portfolio website. My first draft layout was leaning towards minimalism however this did not reflect my personality therefore, I made another draft which showcased my personality more. I have used the wireframe Figma to design them and they were both uploaded here to see the difference between each other.

I first started building using the mobile approach to include the most basic function features then advanced to tablet and PC version for a better user experience. I have used a lot of boostrap and a bit of media quries, and the reason for this was it gave me the ability to easily create a responsive website. In addition, flexbox and grid system was also applied. Morever, I have used the SCSS styling to shorten my code using variables and also group them for simple structure. On top of these, I have also added some icons using Font Awesome and illustrations from unDraw.
